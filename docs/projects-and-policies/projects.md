# Projects

A project is an isolated context within CollieAI. Each project has its own API keys, settings, and active policy. Use projects to separate workloads -- for example, a production chatbot, a staging environment, and an internal copilot can each be their own project with distinct security configurations.

## Creating a project

When you create a project, CollieAI automatically:

1. Assigns your **default policy** as the project's active policy. (If you have not starred a default policy, one is created for you.)
2. Creates an **API key** for the project so you can start sending requests immediately.

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.collieai.io/api/v1/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer clai_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "production-chatbot",
    "description": "Customer-facing AI assistant"
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
  "name": "production-chatbot",
  "description": "Customer-facing AI assistant",
  "active_policy_id": "e5f6a7b8-...",
  "filter_all_messages": true,
  "api_key": {
    "id": "k1l2m3n4-...",
    "name": "production-chatbot-key",
    "prefix": "clai_AbCd..."
  },
  "created_at": "2026-02-23T10:00:00Z"
}
```

## Project settings

### filter\_all\_messages

Controls how CollieAI processes multi-turn conversations:

| Value            | Behavior                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `true` (default) | **All messages** in the conversation are filtered on every request.                                   |
| `false`          | Only the **last message** in the conversation is filtered. Previous messages are forwarded unchanged. |

Filtering all messages provides stronger protection (a user cannot sneak PII into earlier turns), but increases processing time for long conversations. Set to `false` if you only need to filter the latest user message for better performance.

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://app.collieai.io/api/v1/projects/{project_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer clai_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "filter_all_messages": true
  }'
```

## Rate limiting

Control how many requests per minute (RPM) each project can make. This protects against runaway costs and upstream rate limit errors.

The rate limit applies to **all request-processing endpoints** for the project:

* `POST /v1/chat/completions` — sync chat proxy
* `POST /v1/jobs` — async job creation
* `POST /v1/jobs/{id}/response` — async response submission

All endpoints share the same counter, so a project configured with 60 RPM allows 60 total requests per minute across both sync and async usage.

| Setting          | Type            | Default            | Description                 |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `rate_limit_rpm` | integer or null | `null` (unlimited) | Maximum requests per minute |

### Setting a rate limit

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://app.collieai.io/api/v1/projects/{project_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer clai_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"rate_limit_rpm": 60}'
```

### Removing a rate limit

Set `rate_limit_rpm` to `null` to allow unlimited requests:

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://app.collieai.io/api/v1/projects/{project_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer clai_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"rate_limit_rpm": null}'
```

### Rate limit response

When the limit is exceeded, CollieAI returns HTTP 429 with an OpenAI-compatible error:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Max 60 requests per minute. Try again in 12s.",
    "type": "rate_limit_exceeded",
    "code": 429
  }
}
```

Response headers on every request (when rate limiting is configured):

| Header                  | Description                             |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit`     | Configured RPM                          |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Requests remaining in current window    |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset`     | Unix timestamp when the window resets   |
| `Retry-After`           | Seconds to wait (only on 429 responses) |

## Data retention

Each project controls how long its log data lives. Two settings:

* **`body_retention_hours`** (default `48`) — how long `request_body` and `response_body` are kept before being nulled.
* **`log_retention_days`** (default `90`) — how long the rest of the log row is kept before being deleted.

Bodies are higher-sensitivity evidence; metadata is the audit trail. The split lets you keep bodies short (for confidentiality) while keeping metadata long (for compliance).

The invariant `body_retention_hours ≤ log_retention_days × 24` is enforced. Changes apply to **new logs only** — existing rows keep their original expiry.

See [Data Retention](/broken/pages/66aeae909bf1afe8929360e08887f1633cc6c2c9) for full details, recommended values by use case, and special-case behavior.

## Active policy

Every project has exactly one **active policy** that determines which rules apply to incoming and outgoing messages. You can switch the active policy at any time -- the change takes effect immediately for all subsequent requests.

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://app.collieai.io/api/v1/projects/{project_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer clai_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "active_policy_id": "f9a8b7c6-..."
  }'
```

This is useful for:

* **A/B testing policies** -- switch between two policies and compare trigger rates.
* **Instant rollback** -- if a new policy causes issues, switch back to the previous one in a single API call.
* **Environment progression** -- use a lenient policy in staging and a strict one in production.

See [Policies](/broken/pages/5fca45ccde3be5c33dc8274cd8937132fb9d4489) for details on creating and managing policies.

## Deleting a project

Deleting a project is a **hard delete**. The project and its API keys are permanently removed. However, policies and rules linked to the project are **preserved** -- they are unlinked, not deleted. This means:

* The policy that was active on the project remains available for use on other projects.
* Rules within that policy are not affected.
* Provider tokens are user-scoped and are not affected by project deletion.

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://app.collieai.io/api/v1/projects/{project_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer clai_..."
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
This action cannot be undone. All API keys associated with the project will stop working immediately.
{% endhint %}
