# Language detection

## Overview

The Language Detection rule type enables filtering messages based on detected language using FastText's lid.176 model. It supports 176 languages and provides both allowlist and blocklist modes.

**Ideal for:**

* Enforcing language policies (e.g., support only English)
* Blocking specific languages (e.g., compliance requirements)
* Routing messages based on language
* Detecting unexpected language usage

## How It Works

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Message is checked against minimum length requirement
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### FastText lid.176 model detects the primary language
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Detection results are written to shared context for downstream rules

This enables downstream rules to access the language detection results.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Detection confidence is compared against threshold
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Based on mode (allowlist/blocklist), message is allowed or blocked
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Context Sharing

The language detection rule automatically writes detection results to a **shared filtering context** that downstream rules can access. This enables powerful use cases like **language-based model routing**.

**Data written to context:**

| Key                        | Type   | Description                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `detected_language`        | string | ISO 639-1 language code (lowercase)             |
| `language_confidence`      | float  | Detection confidence (0.0-1.0)                  |
| `language_all_predictions` | list   | All language predictions with confidence scores |

**Example:** A `lightweight_model` rule can read `detected_language` from context to apply different ML models based on message language. See [Lightweight Model - Language-Based Routing](/broken/pages/3e9b6f0ccd43d730db3495e5e81c83c03073006c#language-based-model-routing) for details.

## Modes

### Allowlist Mode

Only messages in specified languages pass; all others are blocked/masked.

**Example:** Accept only English and Spanish:

```json
{
  "mode": "allowlist",
  "languages": ["en", "es"],
  "threshold": 0.5
}
```

### Blocklist Mode

Messages in specified languages are blocked; all others pass.

**Example:** Block Russian and Chinese:

```json
{
  "mode": "blocklist",
  "languages": ["ru", "zh"],
  "threshold": 0.5
}
```

| `threshold`         | float  | No       | `0.5`                | Confidence threshold (0.0-1.0)         |
| `min_length`        | int    | No       | `20`                 | Skip messages shorter than this        |
| `mask_placeholder`  | string | No       | `[LANGUAGE_BLOCKED]` | Replacement text                       |
| `decision_on_error` | string | No       | `allow`              | `allow` or `block` on failure          |
| `inference_timeout` | float  | No       | `5.0`                | Max detection time (seconds)           |

  "direction": "all",
  "decision": "block",
  "config": {
    "mode": "blocklist",
    "languages": ["ru", "zh", "ar"],
    "threshold": 0.6
  },
  "block_message": "This language is not permitted."
}
```

### Multi-Language Support (EU Languages)

```json
{
  "name": "EU Languages Only",
  "rule_type": "language_detection",
  "order": 5,
  "direction": "inbound",
  "decision": "block",
  "config": {
    "mode": "allowlist",
    "languages": ["en", "de", "fr", "es", "it", "pt", "nl", "pl", "cs", "sv", "da", "fi", "el", "hu", "ro", "bg", "sk", "sl", "hr", "lt", "lv", "et"],
    "threshold": 0.5
  },
  "block_message": "Only EU languages are supported."
}
```

### Strict English with High Confidence

```json
{
  "name": "Strict English Only",
  "rule_type": "language_detection",
  "order": 5,
  "direction": "inbound",
  "decision": "block",
  "config": {
    "mode": "allowlist",
    "languages": ["en"],
    "threshold": 0.9,
    "min_length": 50,
    "decision_on_error": "block"
  },
  "block_message": "High-confidence English content required."
}
```

## Threshold Guidelines

| Threshold | Trade-off                                    |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `0.3`     | Very permissive, may have false positives    |
| `0.5`     | Balanced (recommended default)               |
| `0.7`     | More strict, fewer false positives           |
| `0.9`     | Very strict, may miss mixed-language content |

**Recommendations:**

* Use `0.5` for general language filtering
* Use `0.7-0.8` when accuracy is important
* Use `0.9` only for high-security scenarios

## Minimum Length

Short messages may produce unreliable language detection. The `min_length` parameter skips analysis for very short texts:

| min\_length | Effect                                 |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `0`         | Analyze all messages (not recommended) |
| `20`        | Default - skip very short messages     |
| `50`        | Skip messages under 50 chars           |
| `100`       | More conservative, only longer texts   |

**Note:** Messages below `min_length` pass through without detection (they are not blocked).

## Error Handling

| `decision_on_error` | Behavior                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `allow`             | Fail-open: message passes if detection fails (default) |
| `block`             | Fail-closed: message blocked if detection fails        |

**Recommendations:**

* Use `allow` (fail-open) for most use cases
* Use `block` (fail-closed) for high-security scenarios where undetected content is risky

## Comparison with Other Rules

| Feature         | Language Detection | Regex     | Dictionary Match |
| --------------- | ------------------ | --------- | ---------------- |
| Detection Type  | ML-based           | Pattern   | Dictionary       |
| Languages       | 176                | N/A       | N/A              |
| Speed           | Fast (\~5ms)       | Very Fast | Very Fast        |
| False Positives | Low                | Depends   | Depends          |
| Mixed Content   | Detects primary    | Per-match | Per-match        |

## Performance

| Metric              | Value                   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Model Load Time     | \~100ms (first request) |
| Inference Time      | \~1-5ms per message     |
| Memory Usage        | \~10MB                  |
| Concurrent Requests | Supported (thread pool) |

**Caching:**

* Model is loaded once and cached in memory
* Subsequent requests reuse the loaded model
* No per-request overhead after initial load

## Troubleshooting

### Detection Not Working

1. Check that the message is longer than `min_length`
2. Verify FastText is installed: `pip install fasttext-wheel`
3. Check logs for model loading errors
4.  **Check model status via health endpoint:**

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health/models
    ```

    Expected response shows `"language_detection": {"loaded": true, ...}`

### Too Many False Positives

1. Increase `threshold` (e.g., 0.5 → 0.7)
2. Increase `min_length` for short messages
3. Check if content is mixed-language

### Model Not Loading (Rule Silently Fails Open)

**Symptom:** Messages in blocked languages pass through without being blocked.

**Cause:** The FastText model failed to load, and the rule fails open (default `decision_on_error: allow`).

**Diagnosis:**

1. Check startup logs for:
   * ✅ `"Language detection model (FastText) preloaded successfully"`
   * ❌ `"Failed to preload language detection model - language_detection rules will fail open!"`
2.  Check model status endpoint:

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health/models
    ```

    If `"language_detection": {"loaded": false}`, the model is not loaded.
3. Check runtime logs for:
   * `"Language detection returned None - model may not be loaded!"`

**Solutions:**

1. **Network access:** Ensure the server can reach `dl.fbaipublicfiles.com` to download the model
2. **Disk space:** Ensure \~2MB free for the model file
3. **Write permissions:** Verify cache directory is writable:
   * Default: `~/.cache/fasttext/`
   * Override with: `FASTTEXT_MODEL_DIR=/path/to/dir`
4. **Docker/containers:** Ensure the cache directory is on persistent storage or pre-download the model
5.  **Manual download:**

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.cache/fasttext
    curl -o ~/.cache/fasttext/lid.176.ftz \
      https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fasttext/supervised-models/lid.176.ftz
    ```

### Unexpected Language Detection

1. Use the test endpoint to see all predictions
2. Check confidence scores - low confidence may indicate mixed content
3. Consider adjusting threshold based on use case

### Production Deployment Checklist

1. ✅ `PRELOAD_MODELS=true` (default) to preload model at startup
2. ✅ Persistent storage for `~/.cache/fasttext/` or set `FASTTEXT_MODEL_DIR`
3. ✅ Network access to `dl.fbaipublicfiles.com` (or pre-download model)
4. ✅ Monitor startup logs for successful model loading
5. ✅ Use `/api/v1/health/models` to verify model status

## Limitations

* Detection is per-message (not per-sentence)
* Mixed-language content may produce unexpected results
* Very short messages may be unreliable
* Some similar languages may be confused (e.g., Norwegian/Danish, Serbian/Croatian)
* Code snippets and URLs may affect detection accuracy

## Best Practices

1. **Start with blocklist mode** for security-focused filtering
2. **Use allowlist mode** for strict language enforcement
3. **Set appropriate min\_length** to avoid false positives on short messages
4. **Test with real data** before deploying to production
5. **Monitor rule triggers** to fine-tune threshold
6. **Use fail-open** (`decision_on_error: allow`) unless security requires otherwise

## Language-Based Routing

The language detection rule can be used to **route messages to language-specific ML models** without blocking any languages. This is achieved through **context sharing** between rules.

### Use Case: Apply Different ML Models by Language

**Pipeline Configuration:**

```
Order 10: language_detection (detects language, writes to context)
Order 20: lightweight_model for English (reads from context, uses DeBERTa v3)
Order 30: lightweight_model for Russian (reads from context, uses Sentinel v2)
Order 100: lightweight_model catch-all (no language filter, processes remaining)
```

**Step 1: Language Detection (order=10)**

Configure to detect language without blocking:

```json
{
  "name": "Detect Language",
  "rule_type": "language_detection",
  "order": 10,
  "direction": "inbound",
  "decision": "allow",
  "config": {
    "mode": "blocklist",
    "languages": ["xx"],
    "threshold": 0.3
  }
}
```

> The `blocklist` mode with a non-existent language code (`"xx"`) ensures all real languages pass through while still writing detection results to context.

**Step 2: Language-Specific ML Rules (order=20+)**

Downstream `lightweight_model` rules can then use the `languages` configuration to process only specific languages:

```json
{
  "name": "English Prompt Guard",
  "rule_type": "lightweight_model",
  "order": 20,
  "config": {
    "model_id": "deepset/deberta-v3-base-injection",
    "languages": ["en"],
    "threshold": 0.80,
    "labels_to_block": ["INJECTION"]
  }
}
```

See [Lightweight Model - Language-Based Routing](/broken/pages/3e9b6f0ccd43d730db3495e5e81c83c03073006c#language-based-model-routing) for complete configuration examples.

### Benefits

1. **No code changes** - Configure routing entirely through rule configuration
2. **Model optimization** - Use the best model for each language
3. **Performance** - Skip ML inference for languages a model wasn't trained on
4. **Flexibility** - Easy to add or modify language-specific models
